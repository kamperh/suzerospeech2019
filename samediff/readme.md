Same-Different Evaluation
=========================

Overview
--------
Same-different is an evaluation task which is slightly different from the
official baseline, but could be a useful way as an intermediate evaluation of
frame-level representations. It is described in:

- M. A. Carlin, S. Thomas, A. Jansen, and H. Hermansky, "Rapid evaluation of
  speech representations for spoken term discovery," in Proc. Interspeech,
  2011.

Here we use it only as a sanity check for the extracted features. At the
moment, this sanity check can only be performed on the ZeroSpeech 2015 data
(because alignments are required to construct the test set).

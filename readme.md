Stellenbosch University ZeroSpeech 2019 System
==============================================

Overview
--------
The [ZeroSpeech challenges](https://zerospeech.com/) aim to answer the question
of how we can build speech processing systems directly from speech audio
without any labels. It has the dual motivation of understanding language
acquisition in humans and developing technology for extremely low-resource
languages. The task in [ZeroSpeech 2019](https://zerospeech.com/2019/) is "TTS
without T", i.e. text-to-speech without textual input. This is the repository
for `suzerospeech`, the Stellenbosch University ZeroSpeech 2019 system.
